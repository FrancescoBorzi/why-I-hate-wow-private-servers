### Disclaimer for fellow developers

IF YOU ARE A WOW EMULATION ENTUSIAST, READ THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING

Here I'm trying to explain things in a simple way, so what you are going to read **might not be 100% technically accurate/detailed** but I really did my best to put things in **simple words** in order to make it **understandable for non-developers**.

For example:

- I'm aware of GPL not being exaclty like [AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License) and I'm aware of the ASP loophole issue
- I know that MaNGOS comes from WoWDaemon and I know that "MaNGOS" wasn't the only piece but to be fair I should mention other projects of the MaNGOS ecosystem such as ScritpDev2, UDB;
- I'm also aware that MaNGOS wasn't the only WoW emulator back in the days (sorry Antrix/Ascent/Arcemu guys! it is absolutely not my intention to belittle your work)
- and I'm probably aware of whatever else you might find not 100% accurate from my article.

**HOWEVER... I just didn't want to make my story more technical than it already is, in order to make any random WoW player understand my point**. 

This is **NOT** supposed to be an accurate story of WoW emulation. This is just supposed to make non-technical people aware of what's going on behind private servers, as nowadays most of them run on MaNGOS-based cores.

**If you think something can be improved, please feel free to send a change-request via PR.**
